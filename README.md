Fracture modeling plays an important role to understand the fluid flow in carbonate reservoirs. However, these reservoirs are often hard to access which makes it difficult to carry out direct surveys. Alternatively, analogue outcrops are a convenient alternative to studying carbonate reservoirs. Furthermore, the fracture characterization to generate Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) can take advantage of the analogue outcrop studies through Virtual Outcrop Models (VOMs), acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and digital photogrammetry. 
The stochastic DFN generation is an important step in reservoir modeling as it brings more representative data to the process and has long been studied. However, optimizations concerning automatizing some of the steps necessary to its generation like data clustering are still open to advancements. In this sense, this work aims the fracture data clustering and the definition of the number of clusters when gathering data for the stochastic process, developing an Elbow method for spherical data and a balanced K-means, both based on Fisher statistics.
Regarding the clustering balance, our method achieved a lower standard deviation between sets while maintaining the Fisher values greater to obtain fracture sets with lower dispersion during the stochastic generation.
